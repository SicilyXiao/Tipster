# Tipster

Tipster is an app that allows users to browse movies from the [The Movie Database API](http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/#).

It is orinally named Flixster but I have a poor listening so I thought it was Tipster. Sorry but it is Tipster now. A little bit weird but sometimes we should accept something outside our inherent perception.
